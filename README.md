# Multiprocessing-dropbox
 Simplified dropbox simulation.
 This is an implementation of multiprocessing communication with pipes and signal handling in order to synchronize a set of files in a common directory.
 
 
  ##  Compilation: 
  ``` Ruby
  make
```
Remove object files: 
 ``` Ruby
  make clean
```
 ##  Run:
  ``` Ruby
./mirror_client -n id -c common_dir -i input_dir -m mirror_dir -b buffer_size -l log_file

```
- id: identifier of current client
- common_dir: common directory for the communication of clients.
- input_dir: directory with the files of client.
- b: size of buffer for reading.
- mirror_dir: the directory in which all files from mirroring clients are stored. Every client creates this directory and shares its files with the rest.
- log_file: output file.

## Bash script create_infiles.sh:
This script creates a hierarchy of files and directories that you can use as input for each client.Names are random alphanumerics from 1 to 8 characters long and letters and files are alphanumerics from 1 kb to 128 kb.


 ##  Run:
  ``` Ruby
./create_infiles.sh dir_name num_of_files num_of_dirs levels

```
## Bash script  get_stats.sh:
This script creates statistics from logfiles.
 ##  Run:
  ``` Ruby
cat log_file1 log_file2 â€¦ log_filen | ./get_stats.sh

```
